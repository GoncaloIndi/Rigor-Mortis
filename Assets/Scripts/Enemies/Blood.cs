    /* Make a vector 3 (Random, Clamp(-1, .3), Random) then make it repeat a random number of times based on the
     amount of blood droplets to go everywhere then instantiate them using look rotation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8N5eHUHcHM at 2:32
     Also use a object pool in order to make it lag less 
     Also probably better to use this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkLtr63_cM instead of the current blood VFX
